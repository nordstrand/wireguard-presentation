## Abstract
It’s more important than ever to use a personal VPN - both for personal internet privacy and for safely accessing your smart-home/IoT-stuff when your’re away from home. 

There’s no shortage of commercial VPN offerings vying for your business - but no option is as satisfying (or secure) as rolling your own setup! 

In this session I’ll demonstrate how you can roll a personal VPN in just 10 minutes with Wireguard - the simple, understandable and elegant VPN system that was recently merged into the Linux kernel source code tree.
